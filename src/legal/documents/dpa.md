# Data Processing Agreement

This Data Processing Agreement ("DPA") is entered into between Concept AI Labs, Inc. ("Provider") and the entity agreeing to these terms ("Customer"). This DPA forms part of the Agreement between Provider and Customer for the provision of the Services. Where this DPA references a Cover Page or Annexes, those details are completed upon execution of a customer agreement or order form incorporating this DPA.

## 1. Processor and Subprocessor Relationships

1.1 Provider as Processor. When Customer controls Customer Personal Data, Provider acts as a Processor handling that data on Customer's behalf.

1.2 Provider as Subprocessor. When Customer is a Processor of Customer Personal Data, Provider functions as a Subprocessor.

## 2. Processing

2.1 Processing Details. Annex I(B) on the Cover Page specifies subject matter, nature, purpose, duration of Processing, Categories of Personal Data, and Categories of Data Subjects.

2.2 Processing Instructions. Customer directs Provider to Process Customer Personal Data: (a) to provide and maintain the Service; (b) as specified through Customer's Service use; (c) as documented in the Agreement; and (d) as documented in other written instructions from Customer acknowledged by Provider. Provider follows these instructions unless Applicable Laws prohibit compliance. Provider immediately notifies Customer of inability to follow instructions. Customer ensures instructions comply with Applicable Laws.

2.3 Processing by Provider. Provider processes Customer Personal Data per this DPA and Cover Page. When Provider updates the Service with new products, features, or functionality, Provider may modify Categories of Data Subjects, Categories of Personal Data, Special Category Data, Restrictions, Safeguards, Transfer Frequency, Processing Nature/Purpose, and Duration by notifying Customer of changes.

2.4 Customer Processing. As a Processor with Provider as Subprocessor, Customer complies with all Applicable Laws governing Customer Personal Data Processing. Customer's Controller agreement similarly requires Processor-level compliance and Subprocessor requirements.

2.5 Consent to Processing. Customer has complied and continues complying with all Applicable Data Protection Laws regarding Customer Personal Data provision to Provider/Service, including all disclosures, consents, choice provisions, and required safeguards.

2.6 Subprocessors.

- (a) Provider cannot provide, transfer, or hand over Customer Personal Data to any Subprocessor without Customer approval. The Approved Subprocessors list includes identities, country locations, and anticipated Processing tasks. Provider notifies Customer at least 10 business days in advance, in writing, of intended Approved Subprocessor changes (additions or replacements), allowing Customer time to object before new Subprocessor engagement. Provider supplies necessary information for Customer to exercise objection rights. Customer has 30 days after notice to object; otherwise Customer accepts changes. If Customer objects within 30 days, both parties cooperate in good faith to resolve the objection.
- (b) Provider's Subprocessor agreements ensure Subprocessors only access/use Customer Personal Data: (i) to extent required for subcontracted obligations; and (ii) consistent with Agreement terms.
- (c) When GDPR applies to Customer Personal Data Processing: (i) DPA data protection obligations (per GDPR Article 28(3)) also apply to Subprocessors; and (ii) Provider's Subprocessor agreement incorporates these obligations, including coordination details for responding to Processing inquiries/requests. Provider shares Subprocessor agreement copies (including amendments) at Customer request. Provider may redact text protecting business secrets, confidential information, or personal data.
- (d) Provider remains fully liable for all Subprocessor obligations, including Subprocessor acts/omissions in Customer Personal Data Processing. Provider notifies Customer of any Subprocessor failures to fulfill material Customer Personal Data obligations.

2.7 No AI Training. Provider will not use Customer Personal Data, including prompts, inputs, outputs, files, logs, metadata, or derivative information, to train, retrain, fine-tune, or improve generalized machine learning or AI models.

2.8 Access Controls and Data Segregation. Customer Personal Data access is restricted to authorized Provider personnel requiring such access to fulfill DPA obligations and bound by confidentiality. Provider maintains logical Customer Personal Data separation across customer environments.

## 3. Restricted Transfers

3.1 Authorization. Customer agrees Provider may transfer Customer Personal Data outside the EEA, United Kingdom, or other relevant territory as necessary for Service provision. When Provider transfers Customer Personal Data to territories lacking European Commission or supervisory authority adequacy decisions, Provider implements appropriate safeguards per Applicable Data Protection Laws.

3.2 Ex-EEA Transfers. When GDPR protects Customer Personal Data transfer from EEA to outside-EEA Provider, lacking European Commission adequacy decision, both parties are deemed to have signed EEA SCCs and Annexes (incorporated by reference) by executing this DPA. Transfers proceed per EEA SCCs, completed as:

- (a) Module Two (Controller to Processor) EEA SCCs apply when Customer is Controller and Provider is Processing Processor.
- (b) Module Three (Processor to Sub-Processor) EEA SCCs apply when Customer is Processor and Provider is Processing Subprocessor.
- (c) For each module (when applicable): (i) Clause 7's optional docking clause does not apply. (ii) Clause 9 applies Option 2 (general written authorization); minimum Subprocessor change notice is 10 business days. (iii) Clause 11's optional language does not apply. (iv) Clause 13 square brackets are removed. (v) Clause 17 (Option 1): EEA SCCs are governed by Governing Member State laws. (vi) Clause 18(b): Disputes resolve in Governing Member State courts. (vii) This DPA's Cover Page contains Annex I, II, and III EEA SCCs required information.

3.3 Ex-UK Transfers. When UK GDPR protects Customer Personal Data transfer from United Kingdom to outside-United Kingdom Provider, lacking United Kingdom Secretary of State adequacy decision, both parties are deemed to have signed the UK Addendum and Annexes (incorporated by reference) by executing this DPA. Transfers proceed per UK Addendum, completed as:

- (a) Section 3.2 of this DPA contains UK Addendum Table 2 required information.
- (b) UK Addendum Table 4 is modified: Neither party may end the UK Addendum per Section 19; to extent ICO issues revised Approved Addendum under Section 18, parties work in good faith to revise this DPA accordingly.
- (c) The Cover Page contains Annex 1A, 1B, II, and III UK Addendum required information.

3.4 Other International Transfers. For Personal Data transfers where Swiss law (not EEA member state or United Kingdom law) applies to international transfer nature, EEA SCCs Clause 4 GDPR references are amended, to legally required extent, to refer to Swiss Federal Data Protection Act or successor instead, and supervisory authority includes Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.

## 4. Security Incident Response

4.1 Upon Security Incident awareness, Provider: (a) notifies Customer without undue delay when feasible, but no later than 72 hours after awareness; (b) provides timely Security Incident information as known or reasonably Customer-requested; and (c) promptly takes reasonable steps containing and investigating the Security Incident. Provider's Security Incident notification or response per this DPA does not constitute Provider fault or liability acknowledgment.

## 5. Audit and Reports

5.1 Audit Rights. Provider supplies all information reasonably necessary demonstrating DPA compliance and allows/contributes to Customer audits, including inspections, assessing DPA compliance. However, Provider may restrict data/information access if Customer access negatively impacts Provider's intellectual property rights, confidentiality obligations, or other Applicable Laws obligations. Customer acknowledges agreeing to exercise DPA and Applicable Data Protection Laws audit rights only by instructing Provider to comply with below reporting/due diligence requirements. Provider maintains DPA compliance records for 3 years post-DPA expiration.

5.2 Security Reports. Provider is pursuing independent third-party compliance certifications (such as SOC 2) and will undergo audits against Security Policy-defined standards as the security program matures. Upon written request, Provider supplies Customer, on confidential basis, available Report summaries or compliance documentation allowing Customer to verify Security Policy-defined standards compliance.

5.3 Security Due Diligence. Beyond the Report, Provider responds to reasonable Customer information requests confirming DPA compliance, including information security, due diligence, audit questionnaire responses, or additional information security program information. All requests must be written, directed to [security@concept.dev](mailto:security@concept.dev), and made once yearly maximum.

## 6. Coordination and Cooperation

6.1 Response to Inquiries. When Provider receives any inquiry or request regarding Customer Personal Data Processing, Provider notifies Customer and does not respond without Customer prior consent. Examples include judicial/administrative/regulatory agency orders regarding Customer Personal Data (where Applicable Law permits notification) or data subject requests. When Applicable Law permits, Provider follows Customer reasonable instructions about requests, including status updates and other reasonably requested information. When data subjects validly request Customer Personal Data deletion or opt-out per Applicable Data Protection Laws, Provider assists Customer in request fulfillment per applicable law. Provider cooperates providing reasonable assistance to Customer, at Customer expense, in any legal response or procedural action Customer takes regarding Provider's Customer Personal Data Processing per this DPA.

6.2 DPIAs and DTIAs. When required by Applicable Data Protection Laws, Provider reasonably assists Customer in conducting mandated data protection impact assessments or data transfer impact assessments and relevant data protection authority consultations, considering Processing and Customer Personal Data nature.

## 7. Deletion of Customer Personal Data

7.1 Deletion by Customer. Provider enables Customer to delete Customer Personal Data consistent with Service functionality. Provider complies as soon as reasonably practicable except where Applicable Law requires further storage.

7.2 Deletion at DPA Expiration.

- (a) Post-DPA expiration, Provider returns or deletes Customer Personal Data per Customer instruction unless further storage is required/authorized by Applicable Law. When return/destruction is impracticable or Applicable Laws-prohibited, Provider makes reasonable efforts preventing additional Customer Personal Data Processing and continues protecting remaining Customer Personal Data in its possession, custody, or control.
- (b) When Customer and Provider have entered EEA SCCs or UK Addendum as this DPA part, Provider only supplies Customer the Personal Data deletion certification described in EEA SCCs Clause 8.1(d) and Clause 8.5 when Customer requests one.

## 8. Limitation of Liability

8.1 Liability Caps and Damages Waiver. To Applicable Data Protection Laws-permitted maximum extent, each party's total cumulative liability to the other party arising from or related to this DPA is subject to Agreement-stated liability waivers, exclusions, and limitations.

8.2 Related-Party Claims. Claims against Provider or its Affiliates arising from or related to this DPA may only be brought by the Customer entity that is Agreement party.

8.3 Exceptions. This DPA does not limit any individual liability regarding individual data protection rights under Applicable Data Protection Laws. Additionally, this DPA does not limit party liability for EEA SCCs or UK Addendum violations.

## 9. Conflicts Between Documents

9.1 This DPA forms and supplements the Agreement part. When inconsistency exists between this DPA, the Agreement, or their parts, earlier-listed parts control over later-listed parts: (1) EEA SCCs or UK Addendum, (2) this DPA, then (3) the Agreement.

## 10. Term of Agreement

10.1 This DPA begins when Provider and Customer agree to a Cover Page and sign or electronically accept the Agreement, continuing until Agreement expiration or termination.
