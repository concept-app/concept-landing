Concept AI Labs, Inc. ("Concept") is committed to protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of customer data. This Security Policy describes the administrative, technical, and organizational measures we use to safeguard information processed through our services.

## 1. Scope

This policy applies to Concept's systems, applications, infrastructure, personnel, and subprocessors involved in the provision of Concept's services.

## 2. Access Controls

Access to customer data is limited to authorized personnel who require access to perform their job responsibilities. Access is granted based on the principle of least privilege and is reviewed periodically.

## 3. Data Protection

Concept uses commercially reasonable measures designed to protect customer data against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. These measures include encryption in transit and access controls appropriate to the sensitivity of the data.

## 4. Use of Customer Data

Customer data is processed solely to provide and support the services as instructed by customers. Concept does not sell customer data and does not use customer data to train general-purpose machine learning models.

## 5. Infrastructure and Vendors

Concept relies on reputable cloud service providers and subprocessors to operate its infrastructure. Subprocessors are subject to security and confidentiality obligations consistent with this policy. A current list of subprocessors is available upon request.

## 6. Monitoring and Logging

Concept maintains logging and monitoring mechanisms designed to detect unauthorized access and security incidents affecting the service.

In the event of a confirmed security incident affecting customer data, Concept will notify affected customers without undue delay, consistent with applicable law and contractual obligations.

## 8. Data Retention and Deletion

Customer data is retained only as long as necessary to provide the services or as required by applicable law. Upon termination of services or upon customer request, Concept deletes customer data in accordance with its data retention practices.

## 9. Personnel Security

All Concept personnel with access to customer data are required to complete security awareness training and are bound by confidentiality obligations. Access is reviewed and adjusted as roles change.

## 10. Security Program Maturity
